# Snake Client Project

Snake is a popular terminal-based game, however this concept is a multiplayer version. 
The player operates a small snake in game, constantly moving to consume food blocks. Everytime you eat a food block, the snake grows in size. The purpose of the game is to avoid hitting the borders, or your/another player's snake as they grow. 

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install below.
